---Plays a note block note through the speaker.
---@param instrument Instrument The instrument to use to play this note.
---@param volume? number The volume to play the note at, from 0.0 to 3.0. Defaults to 1.0.
---@param pitch? number The pitch to play the note at in semitones, from 0 to 24. Defaults to 12.
---@return boolean # Whether the note could be played as the limit was reached.

---Plays a Minecraft sound through the speaker.
---
---This takes the name of a Minecraft sound, such as `"minecraft:block.note_block.harp"`, as well as an optional volume and pitch.
---
---Only one sound can be played at once. This function will return false if another sound was started this tick, or if some audio is still playing.
---@param name string The name of the sound to play.
---@param volume? number The volume to play the sound at, from 0.0 to 3.0. Defaults to 1.0.
---@param pitch? number The pitch to play the sound at, from 0.5 to 2.0. Defaults to 1.0.
---@return boolean # Whether the sound could be played.
function speaker.playSound(name, volume, pitch) end

---Attempt to stream some audio data to the speaker.
---
---This accepts a list of audio samples as amplitudes between -128 and 127. These are stored in an internal buffer and played back at 48kHz. If this buffer is full, this function will return false. You should wait for a speaker_audio_empty event before trying again.
---
---> NOTE:
---> The speaker only buffers a single call to playAudio at once. This means if you try to play a small number of samples, you'll have a lot of stutter. You should try to play as many samples in one call as possible (up to 128Ã—1024), as this reduces the chances of audio stuttering or halting, especially when the server or computer is lagging.

---@param audio number[] A list of amplitudes.
---@param volume? number The volume to play the audio at. If not given, defaults to the previous volume given to `playAudio`.
---@return boolean # If there was room to accept this audio data.
function speaker.playAudio(audio, volume) end

---Stop all audio being played by this speaker.
---
---This clears any audio that playAudio had queued and stops the latest sound played by `playSound`.
function speaker.stop() end
